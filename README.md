# sdr-project

A prototype of a software-defined radio (SDR) capable of real-time signal classification: The ability to detect, classify, and characterize wireless signals is crucial for the efficient use and shared access of the spectrum in SDR-based cognitive and intelligent radio systems. We employ a convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of deep learning algorithm, to classify the modulation of wireless signals. Our demonstration utilizes two different types of radio frequency (RF) front ends for transmitting and receiving signals over the air: the ADALM-PLUTO and the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) equipped with an SBX daughterboard. We achieved a classification accuracy of 95.5% with the ADALM-PLUTO setup and 96.25% accuracy using the USRP N210.
